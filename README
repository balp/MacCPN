Navigation software for the mac.
Ideas and userinterface inspired and partly forked from
OpenCPN (http://www.opencpn.org) but on code level much
of the logic code needed so much rewrite that i think a clean
start is the best way.

TODO:

* Show any chart.
* Add cmake to gererate Xcode project
* gps support
* ais support
